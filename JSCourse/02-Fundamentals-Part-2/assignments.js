/*
Write a function called describeCountry which takes three parameters: country, population and capitalCity. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its capital city is Helsinki'.

Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console.

//ASSIGNMENT N2;
/*
The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called percentageOfWorld1 which receives a population value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

To calculate the percentage, divide the given population value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.

Call percentageOfWorld1 for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console.

Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called percentageOfWolrd2, and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).
