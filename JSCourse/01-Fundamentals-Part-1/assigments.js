/* ASSIGNMENT N2 Data Types
Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.

Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.

/* ASSIGNMENT N3 let const var 
Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).

Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.*/;

/* ASSIGNMENT N4
Basic Operators
If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?

Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console.

Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?

The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have less people than the average country?

Based on the variables you created, create a new variable description which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'.*/

Type Conversion and Coercionï»¿
Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:

console.log('19' - '13' + 17); // -> ?

/*ASSIGNMENT N7 */
/*
Declare a variable numNeighbours based on a prompt input like this:

prompt('How many neighbour countries does your contry have?');
If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now).

Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.

Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value).

Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.

Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?

Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.

Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.
