/* DATA TYPES */

/* there are 7 primitive data types 
1. Number - Floating point numbers, used for decimal and integers let age = 23;
2. String - Sequence of characters, used for text let firstname = 'zhoro;
3. Boolean - Logical type that can only be true or false, used for taking decisions let fullAge = true;
4. Undefined - Value taken by a variable taht is not yet defiend ('empty value') let children;
5. Null - also means 'empty value';
6. Symbol (ES2015) - Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt (E2020) - Larger integers than the Number type can hold
*/

/* JS has dynamic typing, we DO NOT have to manually define the data type of the value stored in the variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically */

/* its the value that has a type, not the variable */
